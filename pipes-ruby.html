<h1> Exploring Elixir Pipes in Ruby</h1>

<pre> Elixir has a Unix-like pipe operator to ferry method results through a series of transformations. It goes something like this

<code>
   String.upcase("Metova") ##"METOVA"
     |> String.reverse     ##"AVOTEM"
     |> String.split("")   ##["A","V","O","T","E","M",""]
</code>

In Ruby, we'd do something like this
<code>
  "Metova".upcase.reverse.split('') ##["A", "V", "O", "T", "E", "M"]
</code>

These look similar at first glance, with Ruby being more sentence-like. There is a key difference, however.
The Ruby methods must be defined on the item being returned from each method call in the chain ( i.e. "String" objects ). Elixir is a functional language, so the data being passed ( the string 'Metova' ) along is simply data. It must be passed as an argument to functions defined in the String module. This is worth stating another way. In Ruby method chains, the return value of the previous method is the <em>receiver</em> of the next message in the chain. In Elixir pipes, the return value of the previous function is the <em>argument</em> to the next function in the chain. This is illustrative of a fundamental difference between Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming.

Let's take a closer look 
<code>
 upcase_test.exs
  ...
   assert String.upcase("Metova") == "METOVA"
   ## passes
  ,,,

 upcase_test.rb
  ...
   expect{"Metova.upcase"}.to eq "METOVA"
   ## also passes
  ...
</code>

The difference:
  Elixir String module receives the message 'Upcase' with the argument "Metova".
  Ruby string "Metova" receives the message 'upcase'.
  
We'll try to implement the Elixir pipe in Ruby ( and see that it's kind of out of line with Ruby's normal OO )

We'll try to call it like this

  "Metova".pipe(:String.upcase).pipe(:reverse).pipe(:split, "")

Because we want to use it in any situation, we'll define pipe on Object

class Object
  def pipe(args)
    #first argument will be the method we want to send
    meth, otherArgs = args.take(1), args.drop(1)
    
    #remember pipe is actually being called on the return value of the previous method call, which we want to pass as the first argument
    firstArg = self
    
    method(meth).call(firstArg, *otherArgs)
    #method is like the functional version of send it's pretty cool and you should check it out. http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Method.html (It's listed under meth in the docs for some reason )
  end
end
  
Another way to emulate this behaviour in ruby is to chain map blocks. This is unzip(file).map{|z| to_temp(z) }.map{|f| make_book(f) }
